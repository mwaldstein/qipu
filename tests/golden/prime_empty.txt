## Quick Reference

  qipu list              List notes
  qipu search <query>    Search notes by title and body
  qipu show <id>         Display a note
  qipu create <title>    Create a new note
  qipu capture           Create note from stdin
  qipu link tree <id>    Show traversal tree from a note
  qipu link path A B     Find path between notes
  qipu context           Build context bundle for LLM

## Session Protocol

**Before ending session:**
1. Capture any new insights: `qipu capture --title "..."`
2. Link new notes to existing knowledge: `qipu link add <new> <existing> --type <type>`
3. Commit changes: `git add .qipu && git commit -m "knowledge: ..."`

**Why this matters:** Knowledge not committed is knowledge lost. The graph only grows if you save your work.

Use `qipu context --note <id>` to fetch full note content.
