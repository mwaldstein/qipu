You are creating/updating the repository's implementation plan.

0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

Primary inputs:
- Product goals: `README.md`
- Implementable specs: `specs/*.md` (see `specs/README.md` for index)
- Non-spec guidance/examples: `docs/*`
- Existing plan: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (if present)
- Shared utilities & components: `src/lib/*`

Task:
1) Read `README.md` to understand scope and non-goals.
2) Study `specs/*.md` to understand required behavior.
   - Use subagents if available.
3) Study `src/lib/*` to understand shared utilities & components.
   - Use subagents if available.
4) Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 subagents to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Use a subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.


Rules:
- Plan only: do NOT implement code.
- Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
- Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.


ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve project goals. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
