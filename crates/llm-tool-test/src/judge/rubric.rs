//! Rubric loading and validation.

//! This module provides functionality for loading rubrics from YAML files
//! and validating their structure.

/// Load a rubric from a YAML file and validate criterion weights sum to 1.0.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `path` - Path to the rubric YAML file
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(Rubric)` - Parsed and validated rubric
/// * `Err` - IO error, parse error, or weight validation error
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an error if:
/// - The file cannot be read
/// - The YAML is malformed
/// - Criterion weights don't sum to approximately 1.0 (within 0.01 tolerance)
